# double-tap-group-project
<<<<<<< HEAD

We split the project up into three sections and have plans to divide the work differently should our fourth and/or fifth assigned partner become available.

The first split we did was the "Sign In" and "Sign Up" pages.
Those were assigned to Chris.

The second split was the "CRM Landing" page.
That was assigned to Nick.

Third split was the "How It Works" Page.
That was assigned to Dylan.
